 ![221352989-518609ab-b4d1-459e-929f-a08cd2bd9b3c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfb60014-6bb2-4d80-9f9d-d2108f5089bc)

**"Engineering at extreme velocity. Architecting the future of autonomous intelligence, one vibe at a time."**

I am an **AI Research Engineer** and **Vibe Coder** focused on bridging the gap between cutting-edge LLM research and production-grade engineering. I specialize in building high-velocity AI observability tools, autonomous agent frameworks, and specialized web ecosystems.

### 🧠 Core Research Focus
*   **AI Reliability & Governance:** Developing frameworks to audit LLM hallucinations and secure agentic decision chains.
*   **Operational Efficiency:** Profiling token consumption and architectural waste in large-scale AI deployments.
*   **Agentic Orchestration:** Building multi-agent systems that self-correct and prioritize safety.
*   **Hardware-Software Synergy:** Optimizing AI-driven hardware controls and low-latency diagnostic dashboards.

### ⚡ The Vibe Coding Philosophy
I believe in **Extreme Prototyping**. By orchestrating advanced AI models, I bypass traditional development bottlenecks to ship functional, research-grade software in hours, not weeks. I don't just write code; I orchestrate systems.
